# Overview of the surfs up analysis:


### Purpose: 

I am interested in opening a surf and shake shop that would serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of O'ahu, Hawaii. In addition to the savings, I need investor backing to get this project off the ground. There is an investor W.Avy that is interested in funding the surf and shake store and is interested in temperature data for June and December to determine if the surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable all year round.

### Results:

The variability in temperature between June and December is minuscule:

- The mean temperature for June (74F) and December (71F) is a difference of 3 degrees while the std. dev. is almost the same (June: 3.2 vs Dec: 3.7), the weather all year round is warm enough for surf and shakes.

- The max. temperature for June (85F) and December (83F) is a difference of 2 degrees.

- The min. temperature for June (64F) and December(56F) is a difference of 8 degrees. Seasonal flavors, promotions, and bonfire seating would attract customers when things look to slow down in the cooler weather.

The mean precipitation in December is .2inches which is 50 % more then the mean in June, it would be considered as moderate rainfall. Precipitation above 0.30 inches is considered heavy rainfall.

 Data with timestamps of when it rained and the duration could determine if it is a short burst of showers as well as if it is raining during open hours or if it is raining at night when the store is closed. The std dev. for the data is also pretty variable we could look at which stations are getting less precipitation and which stations are getting more, determining the ideal location for the surf shop.

Overall the weather in Oahu looks perfect all year round to start a surf and shake store.
