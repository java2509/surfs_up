# Overview of the surfs up analysis:


### Purpose: 

I am interested in opening a surf and shake shop that would serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of O'ahu, Hawaii. In addition to the savings, I need investor backing to get this project off the ground. There is an investor W.Avy that is interested in funding the shake and surf shop after seeing the business plan, he wants to see some data analytics run on a dataset of the weather in O'ahu. W.Avy is interested in temperature data for June and December to determine if the surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable all year round.
