# Overview of the surfs up analysis:


### Purpose: 

I am interested in opening a surf and shake shop that would serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on the beautiful island of O'ahu, Hawaii. In addition to the savings, I need investor backing to get this project off the ground. There is an investor W.Avy that is interested in funding the shake and surf shop after seeing the business plan, he wants to see some data analytics run on a dataset of the weather in O'ahu. W.Avy is interested in temperature data for June and December to determine if the surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable all year round.

### Results:

The variability in temperature between June and December is very small:

- The mean temperature for June (74F) and December (71F) is a difference of 3 degrees while the std. dev. is almost the same (June: 3.2 vs Dec: 3.7), the weather all year round is warm enough for Surfing and Shakes.

- The max. temperature for June (85F) and December (83F) is a difference of 2 degrees.

- The min. temperature for June (64F) and December(56F) is a difference of 8 degress, for the cooler temperatures in December there could be some seasonal flavors and promotions to attract customers when things may slow down.

###  Summary:

Based on the analysis on the temperature alone we can conclude that there are the variability in temperature through out year is small.

Additional analysis that could impact weather:

- Precipatation:

The precipatation is much higher in December,based on the mean percepatation in December rainfall is moderate but anything above 0.30 inches would be considered as heavy rainfall, if we had more data on time stamps on when it rained and the duration that would determine if we are seeing short burst of showers and if it is raining during open hours or if it is raining at night when the store is closed.
